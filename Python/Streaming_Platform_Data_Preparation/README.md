# Streaming Platform Data Preparation

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning, transforming, and preparing raw streaming platform data using **Python** before building dashboards in **Power BI**.

The original dataset was messy and inconsistent, containing missing values, incorrect data types, duplicates, and unstructured fields. Using Python in **Google Colab**, the data was converted into a structured, analysis-ready format suitable for BI reporting and visualization.

This project represents the **data preparation layer** of an end-to-end analytics workflow.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Clean and standardize raw streaming platform data
- Handle missing, duplicate, and inconsistent records
- Transform complex fields into analysis-ready features
- Prepare a final dataset optimized for Power BI dashboards

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Google Colab**
- **Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)**

---

## 🔄 Key Data Preparation Steps
- Removed duplicate records
- Handled missing and null values
- Standardized column names and formats
- Converted data types for analysis
- Created new derived columns where required
- Filtered irrelevant and noisy data
- Exported clean, structured datasets for Power BI

---

## 📊 Outcome
The final output is a **clean, structured dataset** that serves as the foundation for:
- KPI analysis
- Trend analysis
- Content performance dashboards
- User behavior insights in Power BI

> 🔗 This Python project is directly linked to the Power BI Streaming Platform Dashboard.
